== Welcome to RenderCV

RenderCV reads a CV written in a YAML file, and generates a PDF with professional typography.

Each section title is arbitrary.

You can choose any of the 9 entry types for each section.

Markdown syntax is supported everywhere. This is #strong[bold], #emph[italic], and #link("https://example.com")[link].
